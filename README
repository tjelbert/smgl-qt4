This reposiitory is intended to be layered over the standard grimoire, for use in those case where 
you wish to install anything which depends on Qt2, including KDE4 and various applications.

All spells in this grimoire will be installed to '/opt/qt4'.

The reason for doing this is that, although Qt5 and KF5 could be co-installedwith the Qt4/KDE4 
eqivalents, many of the other spells cannot be.

Since it is not known when QT5 based versions of various applications will be released,  we need
a gradual transition from Qt4 to Qt5.

It is possible to to run existing Qt4 based applications the new Plasma Workspace, until a Qt5 
based version becomes available.


I currently have system which has mostly qt5/plasma applications. The only qt4 dependent spells are qt4, 
kdelibs,calligra and a few games.

This repository contains everything from the main grimoire which requires Qt4.
There are many version upgrades and various things have been split int separate components or renamed.
For this reason the recommended upgrade path form the spells in the main grimoire is to delete 
everything that depends on Qt4 and start again.
1. Rebuild qt4
2. build some applications, games, etc.
3. Optionally build kde-workspace, if you wish to run KDE4 sessions.
   KDE-Workspace does not need to be installed when using KDE4 applications on a Plasma5 Workspace.

Users of  KDE Desktop Sessions must be added to the 'kde4' group.

If you intend to use Plasma5 sessions, you will need a Login Manager. SDDM (Simple Display Manager) is 
recommended . It can also start KDE4 sessions.


Use 'scribe add' in order to add it to your stack of grimoires, or edit 
'/etc/sorcery/local/grimoire'.

My stack looks like this, so qt5 has priority over qt4.:

GRIMOIRE_DIR[0]=/var/git/smgl-qt5
#GRIMOIRE_DIR[1]=/var/git/smgl-qt4
GRIMOIRE_DIR[2]=/var/git/localrepos
GRIMOIRE_DIR[3]=/var/git/smgl
GRIMOIRE_DIR[4]=/home/treeve/mygrim
#GRIMOIRE_DIR[5]=/var/git/smgl-b
#GRIMOIRE_DIR[6]=/var/git/smgl-z
