1. all the code in this section is very experimental.
   however, it has compiled for me, and I have run some kde4 programs.

2. the dependencies of the spells are very much in a state of flux.

3. some new dependencies will require several new spells
   e.g. decibel -> tapioca-qt  -> tapioca
   some of these are only available from svn

4. still not clear what is optional and what is required

5. need proper xorg-modular support (most of this was copied from kde3 spells)

6. need sub-depends support
  mostly added

#7. we need to check that our CFLAGS are being used correctly.
#  ok
8. need to check startup scripts (kdm4?), session manager?
   coexistence with kde3?
  duplicate icons on desktop
#9. must setup session bus (dbus) correctly, should not be necessary to do this
#   add 'eval `dbus-launch --auto-syntax` ' to ~./.xsession

10. add an entry for kde4 to /usr/share/xsessions (similar to that for kde3),
     so that can run kde4 from kdm

#11. use the logic from kdebase/{BUILD,INSTALL} to preserve 
#/opt/share/config/kdm/
# ok


12.  need to set XDG_DATA_DIRS in a profile or bashrc

In the standard KDE4 environment you can add
 export XDG_DATA_DIRS=$KDEDIR/share
 to your .bashrc file.
