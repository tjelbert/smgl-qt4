KMyMoney4 is specifically aimed at the typical home user at present.
Each account belongs to an institution and can be reconciled to balance your 
transactions. QIF import and export is supported within accounts so KMyMoney4
can read files exported from other programs and when downloaded from online
banking institutions. A search dialog is also provided to let the user find
transactions that match specific criteria.
